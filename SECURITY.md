## Security Measures

This project implements several security controls:

- **CI/CD Security**: Lint, unit test, E2E test, and build checks on every PR
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated updates via Dependabot for GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: golangci-lint with static analysis
- **Signed Commits**: All commits require sign-off (`git commit -s`)

## Operator-Specific Security
